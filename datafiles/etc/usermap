# usermap - mapping from a local username to a global identity
# example: htj -> "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=Henrik Thostrup Jensen"
# having such mappings will ensure that a user has a single identity in
# the accounting system, instead of multiple local user accounts
#
# remove the # for entries to work
#
# user       userdn

#test        "/O=Grid/O=ExampleOrganization/OU=example.org/CN=Test User"
