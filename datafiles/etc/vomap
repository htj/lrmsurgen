# vomap - a mapping from a local username to global project name (vo)
# example: htj -> "ndgf.org"
# having a vo mapping makes it possible to aggregated numbers for a given
# project which has multiple users and uses multiple machines.
# It is possible to specify both users and local project as a source for a
# mapping. In maui the scheduling group is the project. Torque jobs are not
# assinged a project. You can select a VO name as you see fit, but please
# try and use names which will not clash accidentally, i.e., it is good to
# FQDNs instead of jobs a single name. E.g., "icecube.swegrid.se" would be
# better than "icecube"
